# Data Structure Basics

Anyone learning object oriented programming will eventually come to a point where it is essential that they understand the concept of data structures. Data structures are so important because they allow programmers to store, access, and organize their data. My aim is to help you understand some of the basic concepts of some of these data structues.

The Data Structures we will cover include:
* [Stacks](stacks.md)
* [Sets](sets.md)
* [Trees](trees.md)

For each lesson you will find examples and diagrams. There will also be a problem for to solve in order to demonstrate your knowledge. If you're struggling with a problem for more than an hour, there is a solution provided.
